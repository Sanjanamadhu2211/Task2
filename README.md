# Task2
In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using summary statistics and visualizations. I used histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand feature distributions, detect outliers, and observe relationships. Patterns like higher survival among females and 1st class passengers were identified.

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly
